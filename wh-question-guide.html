<h1>Syntactic Diagnostics for Wh-Questions</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>The morphosyntactic analysis of interrogative constructions offers valuable insights from multiple perspectives. Most notably, it contributes to <strong>identifying the basic word order</strong> of a language, given that previous research has demonstrated systematic correlations between canonical word order and the morphosyntactic strategies employed to mark questions. In addition, such correlations may provide <strong>evidence for processes of syntactic reanalysis</strong> or, more broadly, for typological change. Interrogative structures may thus serve as diagnostics for assessing the position of a language within broader grammatical shifts, as well as for understanding the trajectories along which such changes proceed.</p>

<p>This questionnaire is intended to <strong>facilitate the investigation of the morphosyntactic structure of wh-questions</strong>, with particular emphasis on SOV languages. It is especially designed for use in languages where interrogative constructions remain underdocumented or have not yet been subjected to detailed syntactic analysis. The aim is to provide a structured framework that supports the elicitation of relevant data and guides descriptive work in contexts where the positional behavior of wh-elements is not yet well understood.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the document does not offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis but instead functions as a <strong>practical orientation tool</strong>. Its central goal is to help identify and clarify the key factors, especially the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of wh-elements, that may influence their distribution and positioning within the clause.</p>

<p>In addition to outlining diagnostic questions, this document also highlights relevant <strong>patterns, constraints, and generalisations</strong> observed in cross-linguistic research. These are intended to aid in the interpretation of novel or unexpected syntactic behaviors encountered during fieldwork or descriptive analysis, and to offer a point of reference for hypothesis formation and testing.</p>
