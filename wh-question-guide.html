<h1>Syntactic Diagnostics for Wh-Questions</h1>
<p><em>First Draft â€“ June 2025</em></p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>The morphosyntactic analysis of interrogative constructions offers valuable insights from multiple perspectives. A significant contribution lies in informing hypotheses about the <strong>basic word order</strong> of a language, since prior typological research has uncovered systematic, albeit non-deterministic, correlations between canonical word order and the strategies used to form content questions, such as for instance the placement of wh-elements. While these correlations do not constitute direct predictive rules, they can nevertheless guide comparative analysis and fieldwork.</p>

<p>Furthermore, patterns in the formation of interrogative constructions can serve as diagnostics for <strong>syntactic reanalysis</strong> or broader typological shifts. Interrogative structures may help to identify the stage of a language within ongoing grammatical change and to trace the pathways through which such change unfolds, particularly in cases where interrogative marking interacts with evolving syntactic or information-structural systems.</p>

<p>This questionnaire is intended to <strong>facilitate the investigation of the morphosyntactic structure of wh-questions</strong>, with particular emphasis on SOV languages. Nevertheless, the framework may also inform studies of wh-questions in languages with other basic word orders. Users are encouraged to adapt the diagnostics as appropriate to their language contexts. </p>

<p>The questionnaire is especially designed for use in languages where <strong>interrogative constructions remain underdocumented</strong> or have not yet been subjected to detailed syntactic analysis. The aim is to provide a structured framework that supports the elicitation of relevant data and guides descriptive work in contexts where the positional behavior of wh-elements is not yet well understood.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the document does not offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis but instead functions as a <strong>practical orientation tool</strong>. Its central goal is to help identify and clarify the key factors, especially the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of wh-elements, that may influence their distribution and positioning within the clause.</p>

<p>In addition to outlining diagnostic questions, this document also highlights relevant <strong>patterns, constraints, and generalisations</strong> observed in cross-linguistic research. These are intended to aid in the interpretation of novel or unexpected syntactic behaviors encountered during fieldwork or descriptive analysis, and to offer a point of reference for hypothesis formation and testing.</p>

<h2>Morphosyntactic Profile of the Wh-Phrase</h2>

<p>Establishing the part-of-speech and phrase-level properties of wh-elements is a crucial foundation for their syntactic analysis. This involves identifying the grammatical category of the wh-word (e.g., pronoun, adjective, quantifier, adverb), examining its internal morphological features (such as case, number, or concord/agreement), and observing its syntactic behavior within the phrase. These properties may vary across wh-elements even within a single language, and they often play a decisive role in shaping clause-level phenomena such as positioning, movement, and interpretive constraints.</p>

<p>Close attention to morphosyntactic structure may also reveal patterns or restrictions, such as category-specific behavior in wh-in situ constructions or limitations on which types of wh-elements can undergo fronting. Moreover, this level of analysis tends to be more accessible during the early stages of data collection or fieldwork, as it relies on concrete lexical forms and their observable distributions, rather than on abstract syntactic operations or derivational assumptions.</p>

<p>This parameter encompasses two closely related dimensions:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Morphological distribution:</b> This component addresses the morphological makeup of wh-elements. It focuses on the types of inflectional and derivational morphology that the wh-word can or must bear. Relevant features include case, number, agreement, and any other morphological markings (e.g., classifiers, focus particles, polarity markers) that may co-occur with or attach to the wh-element. The presence or absence of such morphology may also be indicative of the syntactic status or functional role of the wh-element.</li>

<li><b>Syntactic distribution:</b> This aspect concerns the range of syntactic environments in which the wh-element appears and the structural relations it enters into. It involves identifying the potential modifiers of the wh-element (e.g., adjectives, determiners, numerals) as well as the kinds of constituents it can modify (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases). Documenting these dependencies helps clarify the internal syntax of the  wh-phrase and its compatibility with broader phrase structure rules in the language.</li>
</ul>
