  <h1>Syntactic Diagnostics for Wh-Questions in Underdescribed SOV Languages</h1>

  <p><strong>Author:</strong> [Nikolett Mus]</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p> This questionnaire is designed to support the investigation of the syntactic structure of wh-questions in SOV languages, particularly those whose interrogative constructions have received little to no detailed syntactic description to date.</p>
  <p>Rather than offering a comprehensive analysis, the document functions as a practical orientation tool, particularly in cases where the syntactic configuration of wh-questions appears, at least superficially, to mirror that of declarative ones.</p>
<p>Among the central issues in the study of wh-questions is the syntactic position of wh-expressions. Accordingly, the present guide places primary emphasis on this aspect.</p>
<p>The central aim is to help to identify and elucidate the potential factors, most notably, the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of wh-elements, that may condition/influence their positional behavior within the clause.</p>

<h2>1. Part-of-Speech and Phrase-Level Function of the Wh-Phrase</h2>

<p>This parameter concerns the grammatical category and syntactic behavior of the wh-expression, considered at the level of the phrase in which it appears. The goal is to determine the morphosyntactic profile of the wh-phrase in the language under investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Morphological distribution:</b>b> This aspect focuses on the morphological properties of the wh-words. Specifically, it examines the types of affixes (both inflectional and derivational) that the wh-element can or must carry. This includes number and case marking, agreement morphology, and any other relevant morphological features that may be added to a wh-word.</li>

<li><b>Syntactic distribution:</b>b> This refers to the range of syntactic environments in which the wh-word can occur. It involves identifying the phrase's co-occurrence patterns and syntactic dependencies: for instance, what kinds of modifiers it can take (e.g., adjectives, determiners), what elements it can modify (e.g., nouns, verbs).</li>
</ul>
