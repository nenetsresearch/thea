<h1>Syntactic Diagnostics for Wh-Questions</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>The morphosyntactic analysis of interrogative constructions offers valuable insights from multiple perspectives. A significant contribution lies in informing hypotheses about the <strong>basic word order</strong> of a language, since prior typological research has uncovered systematic, albeit non-deterministic, correlations between canonical word order and the strategies used to form content questions, such as for instance the placement of wh-elements. While these correlations do not constitute direct predictive rules, they can nevertheless guide comparative analysis and fieldwork.</p>

<p>Furthermore, patterns in the formation of interrogative constructions can serve as diagnostics for <strong>syntactic reanalysis</strong> or broader typological shifts. Interrogative structures may help to identify the stage of a language within ongoing grammatical change and to trace the pathways through which such change unfolds, particularly in cases where interrogative marking interacts with evolving syntactic or information-structural systems.</p>

<p>This questionnaire is intended to <strong>facilitate the investigation of the morphosyntactic structure of wh-questions</strong>, with particular emphasis on SOV languages. Nevertheless, the framework may also inform studies of wh-questions in languages with other basic word orders. Users are encouraged to adapt the diagnostics as appropriate to their language contexts. </p>

<p>The questionnaire is especially designed for use in languages where <strong>interrogative constructions remain underdocumented</strong> or have not yet been subjected to detailed syntactic analysis. The aim is to provide a structured framework that supports the elicitation of relevant data and guides descriptive work in contexts where the positional behavior of wh-elements is not yet well understood.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the document does not offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis but instead functions as a <strong>practical orientation tool</strong>. Its central goal is to help identify and clarify the key factors, especially the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of wh-elements, that may influence their distribution and positioning within the clause.</p>

<p>In addition to outlining diagnostic questions, this document also highlights relevant <strong>patterns, constraints, and generalisations</strong> observed in cross-linguistic research. These are intended to aid in the interpretation of novel or unexpected syntactic behaviors encountered during fieldwork or descriptive analysis, and to offer a point of reference for hypothesis formation and testing.</p>


<p><strong>This questionnaire is part of an ongoing project aimed at systematically documenting and comparing the typological variation of wh-interrogatives across languages. While the current version outlines a number of core parameters in detail, additional areas are under active development. The following topics represent key aspects that will be addressed in future iterations of the questionnaire, either through expanded discussion, refined diagnostics, or the inclusion of additional cross-linguistic data.</strong></p>
  
<h2>Morphosyntactic Profile of the Wh-Phrase</h2>

<p>This aspect of wh-words concerns the systematic identification of their <strong>parts of speech</strong>. It involves analysing its <strong>morphological behaviour</strong> (e.g., case, number, agreement) and <strong>syntactic distribution</strong>. Although not strictly part of parts-of-speech classification, it is also important to observe the morphosyntactic patterns that emerge within phrases containing wh-elements. These properties often vary across wh-forms even within a single language, and they significantly influence clause-level phenomena, such as linear position, movement potential, and interpretive constraints.</p>

<p>For this parameter, there are three main issues should be examined:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Morphological distribution:</b> This component focuses on the types of <strong>inflectional</strong> and <strong>derivational</strong> suffixes that wh-words may or must bear. Relevant features include number, case, and any other morphological markings, e.g., classifiers, focus particles, polarity markers, that may co-occur with or attach to the wh-element. The presence or absence of such morphology may indicate the syntactic status or functional role of the wh-element.</li>

<li><b>Syntactic distribution:</b> This aspect addresses the range of syntactic environments in which the wh-element appears and the structural relations it enters into. It includes identifying the potential modifiers of the wh-element, e.g., adjectives, determiners, numerals, as well as the kinds of constituents it can itself modify, e.g., NPs, DPs, VPs. Documenting these dependencies helps clarify the internal syntax of the wh-phrase and its compatibility with the broader phrase structure of the language.</li>

<li><b>Concord and internal position within the wh-phrase:</b> This component concerns agreement relations within the phrase, like number, case, person, and the relative ordering of determiners, adjectives, and wh-elements. These patterns can reveal typological tendencies and contribute to a better understanding of the structure and headedness of noun phrases in the language.</li>
</ul>
