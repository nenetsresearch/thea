  <p>This document is a draft outlining the techniques, considerations, and conventions used in annotating spoken language-specific features, such as prosodic tags, discourse-related phenomena, and structural relations, in the Tundra Nenets data included in the first release of the Nenets UD Treebank. It reflects the preliminary practices adopted during the annotation process and serves as a reference for ongoing development and refinement.</p>
